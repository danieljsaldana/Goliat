## Development

This theme is still under development and is based on modern technologies like Gulp/PostCSS to leverage future CSS specifications. To contribute or make changes, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)

From the theme's root directory, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Build and watch for changes
yarn dev
```

You can now edit the files in `/assets/css/`, which will be automatically compiled into `/assets/built/`.

To create a `zip` file ready for upload, use the following command:

```bash
yarn zip
```

The generated file will be located in `dist/goliat.zip`.
